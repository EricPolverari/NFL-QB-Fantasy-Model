# Predicting NFL QB Fantasy Performance

This project uses NFL Next Gen Stats to model and predict quarterback fantasy point production. The analysis focuses on advanced tracking metrics such as Time to Throw, Completed Air Yards, and Completion Probability.

## Tools Used
- RStudio
- NFL Next Gen Stats (2016â€“2021)

## Key Outcomes
- LCAD (Longest Completed Air Distance), AYTS (Air Yards to the Sticks), and Completion Probability emerged as the most predictive features.
- Applied regression modeling and feature evaluation to build a flexible model for forecasting weekly fantasy output.
- Findings suggest potential value for scouting and game-planning based on tracking data insights.

## Purpose
To explore how player tracking data can be used to evaluate quarterback performance beyond traditional box score stats, and to highlight the predictive power of advanced passing metrics in fantasy and real-game contexts.
